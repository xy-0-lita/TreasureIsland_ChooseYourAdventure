# TreasureIsland_ChooseYourAdventure
A text-based adventure game built with Python as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge (Angela Yu, Udemy).
## About

You find yourself on a mysterious foggy road with a single mission: find the treasure. Every choice matters—one wrong turn could end your quest.

## Features

- Multiple branching story paths
- ASCII art introduction
- Replay functionality
- Simple, beginner-friendly code

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xy-0-lita/TreasureIsland_ChooseYourAdventure.git
   cd TreasureIsland_ChooseYourAdventure
```

2. Run the game:
```bash
   python play_adventure.py
```

3. Follow the prompts and make your choices carefully!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Game Structure

The game uses conditional logic (if/elif/else) to create branching narratives. Players make choices at key decision points:
- **First choice**: Left or right at the fork
- **Second choice**: Wait or swim at the lake
- **Final choice**: Which colored door to enter

Only one path leads to victory!

## Learning Goals

This project demonstrates:
- Input validation
- Conditional statements
- Function structuring
- Program flow control
- User interaction loops
